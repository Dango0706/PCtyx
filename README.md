# PCtyx Open Project

The Construct 2 project of PCtyx Editor will be available soon.

Construct 2 is a game maker (Windows only) that you can develop HTML5 games without any coding knowledge. A paid/(a four letter word that shall not be named here) version of Construct 2 is required due to more than 4 layers and 100+ events are used.

## Limitations
Compared to the public master branch releases, the open project strips the following:
- No settings are saved and chart backup is disabled.
- The Check Update and Help Manual in the setting screen does nothing.
- No custom noteskin.
- No video.
- You can only save the chart as .csv. 
- No support of older version of csv files and .pton files.
- The beat is the tambourine sound from compose mode.
