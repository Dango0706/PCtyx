# PCtyx Open Project

The Construct 2 project of PCtyx Editor will be available soon.

Construct 2 is a game maker (Windows only) that you can develop HTML5 games without any coding knowledge. A paid/(a four letter word that shall not be named here) version of Construct 2 is required due to more than 4 layers and 100+ events are used.

## Limitations
**For average users**: please do not use this to make charts; Use the released builds in public branch.

This open project branch is meant for developer and contributors who wanted to add new features for PCtyx. 

Compared to the public master branch releases, the open project strips the following:
- Settings and chart backup are not saved.
- The Check Update and Help Manual in the setting screen does nothing.
- No custom noteskin.
- No video.
- Only .csv is saved. (Although events of writing sb and c2.txt files are still intact)
- No support of older version of .csv, .pton, and c1.txt files.
- The clickFX used the tambourine sound from compose mode.
