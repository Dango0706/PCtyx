The project is made in Construct 2, exported as an NW.js application. This project is solely used as one of the custom chart application for Cytoid and/or personal use; this project is not intended for commercial purpose.

## Application Download
Go to the **Releases** tab, then download the latest version matching your platform.
* x64 or win64 - Windows 64-bit
* x86 or win32 - Windows 32-bit
* osx - Mac OSX
* linux64 - Linux 64 bit (only available at v150 onwards)
* linux32 - Linux 32 bit (only available at v150 onwards)

Unless stated as fixed, due to file permissions differ between each platform, OSX and Linux versions in the releases are broken and require to do the following steps included in the **README.txt** file once in order to have them run properly. As of 210 version onward, OSX version is already fixed and does not require workaround.
